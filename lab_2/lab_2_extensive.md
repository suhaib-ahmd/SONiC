## Device Addressing

| Device | AS | Loopback   | Ethernet0    | Spine4-facing IP |
|--------|----|------------|--------------|------------------|
| Spine4 | 4  | 4.4.4.4/32 | —            | —                |
| Leaf1  | 1  | 1.1.1.1/32 | 1.4.1.1/24   | 1.4.1.4/24       |
| Leaf2  | 2  | 2.2.2.2/32 | 2.4.1.2/24   | 2.4.1.4/24       |
| Leaf3  | 3  | 3.3.3.3/32 | 3.4.1.3/24   | 3.4.1.4/24       |

### Spine4 Interface Map

| Interface  | Connects to | IP          |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Ethernet0  | Leaf1       | 1.4.1.4/24  |
| Ethernet4  | Leaf2       | 2.4.1.4/24  |

## Step 1 — Split-Unified Routing Mode

> Run on **all devices**. Required before configuring FRR.

```bash
cat > /tmp/routing_mode.json << 'EOF'
{
    "DEVICE_METADATA": {
        "localhost": {
            "docker_routing_config_mode": "split-unified"
        }
    }
}
EOF

sudo config load /tmp/routing_mode.json -y
sudo config save -y
sudo systemctl restart bgp
```

Verify:

```bash
show runningconfiguration all | grep docker_routing_config_mode
```

Expected: `"docker_routing_config_mode": "split-unified"`

---

## Step 2 — Interface IPs

**Leaf1:**

```bash
sudo config interface ip add Ethernet0 1.4.1.1/24
sudo config interface ip add Loopback0 1.1.1.1/32
sudo config save -y
```

**Leaf2:**

```bash
sudo config interface ip add Ethernet0 2.4.1.2/24
sudo config interface ip add Loopback0 2.2.2.2/32
sudo config save -y
```

**Leaf3:**

```bash
sudo config interface ip add Ethernet0 3.4.1.3/24
sudo config interface ip add Loopback0 3.3.3.3/32
sudo config save -y
```

**Spine4:**

```bash
sudo config interface ip add Ethernet0 1.4.1.4/24
sudo config interface ip add Ethernet4 2.4.1.4/24
sudo config interface ip add Ethernet8 3.4.1.4/24
sudo config interface ip add Loopback0 4.4.4.4/32
sudo config save -y
```

### Verification — show ip interfaces

```bash
show ip interfaces
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
Interface    Master    IPv4 address/mask    Admin/Oper    BGP Neighbor    Neighbor IP
-----------  --------  -------------------  ------------  --------------  -------------

Loopback0              1.1.1.1/32           up/up         N/A             N/A
docker0                240.127.1.1/24       up/down       N/A             N/A
eth0                   192.168.122.66/24    up/up         N/A             N/A
lo                     127.0.0.1/16         up/up         N/A             N/A
```

All lab interfaces must show `up/up` before proceeding.

---

## Step 3 — Underlay BGP

> **FRR defaults to be aware of:**
> - **`bgp ebgp-requires-policy`** is enabled by default in FRR. Every eBGP neighbor must have an explicit inbound and outbound route-map applied, or no routes will be exchanged. This is why `route-map PASS` is applied to all neighbors.
> - **`no bgp default ipv4-unicast`** is set explicitly here. By default in FRR, all neighbors are automatically activated in the IPv4 unicast address-family. Disabling this ensures neighbors are only activated where explicitly configured.

> Enter `vtysh` on each device before pasting.

## Step 4 — Extensive Verification

### 4.1 FRR Running Configuration

Confirms the full FRR config is applied as expected. Check router-id, AS number, peer-group membership, route-maps, and prefix-lists.

```bash
vtysh -c 'show running-config'
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
frr version 8.5.4

---

### 4.2 BGP Neighbor Summary

All neighbors must show a numeric `PfxRcd` value (not `Active`, `Idle`, or `Connect`).

Run the following on **both Leaf1 and Spine4**:

```bash
vtysh -c 'show bgp ipv4 unicast summary'
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
BGP router identifier 1.1.1.1, local AS number 1 vrf-id 0
BGP table version 21
RIB entries 17, using 3808 bytes of memory
Peers 1, using 22 KiB of memory
Peer groups 1, using 64 bytes of memory

Neighbor        V         AS   MsgRcvd   MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ  Up/Down State/PfxRcd   PfxSnt Desc
1.4.1.4         4          4        25        12        0    0    0 00:00:31            8        1 N/A

Total number of neighbors 1
```

- `PfxRcd 8` — 8 prefixes received from Spine4 (loopbacks + connected subnets from all devices).
- `PfxSnt 1` — only the local loopback (`1.1.1.1/32`), filtered by the `ADVERTISE` route-map.

**Spine4** output:
```
BGP router identifier 4.4.4.4, local AS number 4 vrf-id 0
BGP table version 11
RIB entries 17, using 3808 bytes of memory
Peers 3, using 66 KiB of memory
Peer groups 1, using 64 bytes of memory

Neighbor        V         AS   MsgRcvd   MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ  Up/Down State/PfxRcd   PfxSnt Desc
1.4.1.1         4          1        14        27        0    0    0 00:00:38            1        9 N/A
2.4.1.2         4          2        14        38        0    0    0 00:07:01            1        9 N/A
3.4.1.3         4          3        17        48        0    0    0 00:07:01            1        9 N/A

Total number of neighbors 3
```

- All three leaf sessions are `Established` with `PfxRcd 1` — each leaf advertises only its loopback.
- `PfxSnt 9` — Spine4 sends all connected subnets plus every loopback it has learned from the other leaves.

---

### 4.3 BGP Route Table

`*>` marks the best path. Remote loopbacks should show AS paths through the spine.

```bash
vtysh -c 'show bgp ipv4 unicast'
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
BGP table version is 21, local router ID is 1.1.1.1, vrf id 0

Displayed  9 routes and 12 total paths
```

- Remote loopbacks (`2.2.2.2/32`, `3.3.3.3/32`, `4.4.4.4/32`) show AS paths through Spine4 (AS 4).
- Locally originated routes have next-hop `0.0.0.0` and weight `32768`.
- For shared subnets (`1.4.1.0/24`), both a local and remote path exist — the local path (`*>`) wins.

### 4.4 Detailed BGP Neighbor Information

Full session details: capabilities, timers, message counters, graceful restart state.

```bash
vtysh -c 'show bgp neighbors 1.4.1.4'
```

**Leaf1** output:

 For address family: IPv4 Unicast
  SPINE peer-group member
  Route map for incoming advertisements is *PASS

  8 accepted prefixes

  Connections established 2; dropped 1
Local host: 1.4.1.1, Local port: 179
Foreign host: 1.4.1.4, Foreign port: 43234
```

Key fields to verify:
- **BGP state = Established** — session is up and exchanging routes.
- **Hold time / keepalive** — default 180s/60s. If the hold timer expires, the session drops.
- **Route map for incoming / outgoing** — confirms `PASS` inbound and `ADVERTISE` outbound.
- **8 accepted prefixes** — matches what `show bgp summary` reports.
- **Connections established / dropped** — high drop counts indicate instability.

---

### 4.5 Route-Map Verification

Shows invocation counts — how many times each route-map was evaluated and how many routes matched.

```bash
vtysh -c 'show route-map'
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
ZEBRA:
route-map: RM_SET_SRC Invoked: 10
 permit, sequence 10 Invoked 10
  Set clauses:
    src 1.1.1.1

BGP:
route-map: ADVERTISE Invoked: 18
 permit, sequence 10 Invoked 2
  Match clauses:
    ip address prefix-list LOOPBACKS

route-map: PASS Invoked: 16
 permit, sequence 10 Invoked 16
  Match clauses:
```

- `ADVERTISE Invoked 2` out of 18 evaluations — only the loopback matched. The rest were implicitly denied (connected subnets filtered out).
- `PASS Invoked 16` — all inbound prefixes passed through.
- `RM_SET_SRC Invoked 10` — applied to BGP routes installed into the kernel, setting the loopback as source.

---

### 4.6 FRR IP Route Table

`B>*` = best BGP route installed in FIB. `C>*` = directly connected. `rmapsrc` confirms the source-address route-map is working.

```bash
vtysh -c 'show ip route'
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
Codes: K - kernel route, C - connected, S - static, R - RIP,
       O - OSPF, I - IS-IS, B - BGP, E - EIGRP, N - NHRP,
       T - Table, v - VNC, V - VNC-Direct, A - Babel, F - PBR,
       f - OpenFabric, J - Adjacency,
       > - selected route, * - FIB route, q - queued, r - rejected, b - backup
       t - trapped, o - offload failure

K * 0.0.0.0/0 [0/202] via 192.168.122.1, eth0, 00:06:40
K>* 0.0.0.0/0 [0/0] via 192.168.123.1, eth4, 00:06:40
C>* 1.1.1.1/32 is directly connected, Loopback0, 00:05:28
C>* 1.4.1.0/24 is directly connected, Ethernet0, 00:02:19
B>* 2.2.2.2/32 [20/0] via 1.4.1.4, Ethernet0, rmapsrc 1.1.1.1, weight 1, 00:00:30
B>* 2.4.1.0/24 [20/0] via 1.4.1.4, Ethernet0, rmapsrc 1.1.1.1, weight 1, 00:00:30
B>* 3.3.3.3/32 [20/0] via 1.4.1.4, Ethernet0, rmapsrc 1.1.1.1, weight 1, 00:00:30
B>* 3.4.1.0/24 [20/0] via 1.4.1.4, Ethernet0, rmapsrc 1.1.1.1, weight 1, 00:00:30
B>* 4.4.4.4/32 [20/0] via 1.4.1.4, Ethernet0, rmapsrc 1.1.1.1, weight 1, 00:00:30
C>* 192.168.122.0/24 is directly connected, eth0, 00:06:40
C>* 192.168.123.0/24 is directly connected, eth4, 00:06:40
K>* 240.127.1.0/24 [0/0] is directly connected, docker0, 00:06:40
```

- `rmapsrc 1.1.1.1` — `RM_SET_SRC` is working, forcing the loopback as the source for BGP-learned routes.
- `[20/0]` — administrative distance 20 (eBGP), metric 0.

### 4.7 Route Programming & Nexthop Resolution — Kernel, APP_DB, and ASIC

A route in the BGP RIB is useless unless it is programmed all the way down to the hardware ASIC and the next-hop can be resolved to a directly connected neighbor. This section traces the full route-programming chain from the Linux kernel through SONiC's APP_DB down to the hardware ASIC, and shows how the nexthop is resolved at each layer.

#### Linux Kernel Route Table

The kernel is what actually forwards packets. `proto bgp` confirms FRR (Zebra) programmed the route. The `src` field shows the source address set by `RM_SET_SRC`.

```bash
ip route show proto bgp
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
2.2.2.2 via 1.4.1.4 dev Ethernet0 src 1.1.1.1 metric 20
2.4.1.0/24 via 1.4.1.4 dev Ethernet0 src 1.1.1.1 metric 20
3.3.3.3 via 1.4.1.4 dev Ethernet0 src 1.1.1.1 metric 20
3.4.1.0/24 via 1.4.1.4 dev Ethernet0 src 1.1.1.1 metric 20
4.4.4.4 via 1.4.1.4 dev Ethernet0 src 1.1.1.1 metric 20
```

If `src` showed `1.4.1.1` (the Ethernet0 address) instead of `1.1.1.1` (the loopback), the `RM_SET_SRC` route-map is missing or not applied.

#### Linux ARP / Neighbor Table

For the kernel to forward to `1.4.1.4`, it needs the MAC address of that next-hop. The ARP table shows the L2 resolution.

```bash
ip neigh show dev Ethernet0
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
1.4.1.4 lladdr 78:61:32:bf:bc:00 REACHABLE
```

The next-hop is `REACHABLE`. If it shows `FAILED` or `INCOMPLETE`, L2 adjacency is broken (check interface state, cabling, or IP mismatch).

#### SONiC APP_DB (ROUTE_TABLE and NEIGH_TABLE)

FRR pushes routes to the SONiC `fpmsyncd` daemon via the FPM (Forwarding Plane Manager) socket. `fpmsyncd` writes them into APP_DB's `ROUTE_TABLE`, which `orchagent` then programs into the ASIC.

List all routes in APP_DB:

```bash
sonic-db-cli APPL_DB keys 'ROUTE_TABLE:*'
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
ROUTE_TABLE:0.0.0.0/0
ROUTE_TABLE:1.1.1.1
ROUTE_TABLE:1.4.1.0/24
ROUTE_TABLE:2.2.2.2
ROUTE_TABLE:2.4.1.0/24
ROUTE_TABLE:3.3.3.3
ROUTE_TABLE:3.4.1.0/24
ROUTE_TABLE:4.4.4.4
```

Inspect a specific route to see the nexthop and egress interface:

```bash
sonic-db-cli APPL_DB hgetall 'ROUTE_TABLE:2.2.2.2'
```

```
{'protocol': 'bgp', 'nexthop': '1.4.1.4', 'ifname': 'Ethernet0'}
```

```bash
sonic-db-cli APPL_DB hgetall 'ROUTE_TABLE:4.4.4.4'
```

```
{'protocol': 'bgp', 'nexthop': '1.4.1.4', 'ifname': 'Ethernet0'}
```

All remote loopbacks point to nexthop `1.4.1.4` via `Ethernet0`.

The neighbor's MAC is stored in NEIGH_TABLE — this is what `orchagent` uses to program the ASIC's L2 rewrite entry:

```bash
sonic-db-cli APPL_DB hgetall 'NEIGH_TABLE:Ethernet0:1.4.1.4'
```

```
{'neigh': '78:61:32:bf:bc:00', 'family': 'IPv4'}
```

This matches the ARP entry from `ip neigh show`.

#### SONiC ASIC_DB (SAI Object Store)

> **Where does ASIC_DB fit?** `orchagent` reads from APP_DB, translates routes/neighbors into SAI (Switch Abstraction Interface) objects, and writes them to ASIC_DB. The SAI SDK then programs the actual hardware. ASIC_DB is therefore the *canonical record* of what `orchagent` asked the ASIC to do — if a route is in APP_DB but missing from ASIC_DB, `orchagent` failed to process it.
>
> The `show platform npu` commands (next section) read back from the hardware directly. ASIC_DB shows you what was *requested*; the NPU CLI shows you what was *programmed*.

ASIC_DB keys are SAI object types with JSON-encoded key fields. The main ones for route verification are:

| SAI Object Type | What it stores |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTE_ENTRY` | Prefix → nexthop OID mapping |
| `SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_NEXT_HOP` | Nexthop IP + router interface OID |
| `SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_NEIGHBOR_ENTRY` | Neighbor IP → destination MAC |
| `SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTER_INTERFACE` | Interface → port OID, source MAC, MTU |

##### List all route entries

```bash
sonic-db-cli ASIC_DB keys 'ASIC_STATE:SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTE_ENTRY:*'
```

**Leaf1** output (IPv4 entries only):

```

##### Trace a single route through ASIC_DB

Look up the route entry for `2.2.2.2/32` to find the nexthop OID it points to:

```bash
sonic-db-cli ASIC_DB hgetall 'ASIC_STATE:SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTE_ENTRY:{"dest":"2.2.2.2/32","switch_id":"oid:0x21000000000000","vr":"oid:0x3000000000042"}'
```

```
{'SAI_ROUTE_ENTRY_ATTR_NEXT_HOP_ID': 'oid:0x400000000097e'}
```

Follow the nexthop OID to find the IP and router interface:

```bash
sonic-db-cli ASIC_DB hgetall 'ASIC_STATE:SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_NEXT_HOP:oid:0x400000000097e'
```

```
{'SAI_NEXT_HOP_ATTR_TYPE': 'SAI_NEXT_HOP_TYPE_IP', 'SAI_NEXT_HOP_ATTR_IP': '1.4.1.4', 'SAI_NEXT_HOP_ATTR_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ID': 'oid:0x600000000096b'}
```

Look up the neighbor entry for `1.4.1.4` to find the destination MAC:

```bash
sonic-db-cli ASIC_DB hgetall 'ASIC_STATE:SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_NEIGHBOR_ENTRY:{"ip":"1.4.1.4","rif":"oid:0x600000000096b","switch_id":"oid:0x21000000000000"}'
```

```
{'SAI_NEIGHBOR_ENTRY_ATTR_DST_MAC_ADDRESS': '78:61:32:BF:BC:00'}
```

Optionally, check the router interface to confirm the egress port and source MAC:

```bash
sonic-db-cli ASIC_DB hgetall 'ASIC_STATE:SAI_OBJECT_TYPE_ROUTER_INTERFACE:oid:0x600000000096b'
```

```
{'SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_VIRTUAL_ROUTER_ID': 'oid:0x3000000000042', 'SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_SRC_MAC_ADDRESS': '78:EC:2B:CF:A8:00', 'SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_TYPE': 'SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_TYPE_PORT', 'SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_PORT_ID': 'oid:0x1000000000002', 'SAI_ROUTER_INTERFACE_ATTR_MTU': '9100'}
```

The full ASIC_DB chain for `2.2.2.2/32`:

```
Route  →  nexthop OID 0x400000000097e
           →  IP 1.4.1.4, router-interface OID 0x600000000096b
                →  dst-MAC 78:61:32:BF:BC:00 (neighbor entry)
                →  src-MAC 78:EC:2B:CF:A8:00, port OID 0x1000000000002, MTU 9100 (router interface)
```

> **Note:** All BGP-learned routes (`2.2.2.2/32`, `3.3.3.3/32`, `4.4.4.4/32`, etc.) point to the same nexthop OID `0x400000000097e` because they all resolve via the single nexthop `1.4.1.4` on Ethernet0.

#### ASIC / NPU Verification (show platform npu)

These commands query the hardware ASIC directly. If a route is in APP_DB but not in the NPU route table, `orchagent` failed to program it.

##### NPU Route Table

Shows every prefix programmed into the ASIC. `dest-type` tells you what happens to matching packets:
- `next-hop` — forwarded via a resolved nexthop (normal routing)
- `for-us` — destined to the switch itself (local IPs)
- `host` — connected subnet (glean/ARP resolution)

```bash
sudo show platform npu router route-table
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
+-----------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+-------+--------+
| router-id | ip-prefix      | dest-type | dest-info                       | drop  | ip-ver |
+-----------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+-------+--------+
| 0x0       | 1.1.1.1/32     | for-us    | N/A                             | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 1.4.1.1/32     | for-us    | N/A                             | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 1.4.1.0/24     | host      | N/A                             | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 2.2.2.2/32     | next-hop  | ['normal', '78:61:32:bf:bc:00'] | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 2.4.1.0/24     | next-hop  | ['normal', '78:61:32:bf:bc:00'] | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 3.3.3.3/32     | next-hop  | ['normal', '78:61:32:bf:bc:00'] | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 3.4.1.0/24     | next-hop  | ['normal', '78:61:32:bf:bc:00'] | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 4.4.4.4/32     | next-hop  | ['normal', '78:61:32:bf:bc:00'] | False | 4      |
| 0x0       | 0.0.0.0/0      | next-hop  | drop                            | True  | 4      |
+-----------+----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+-------+--------+
```

- All BGP-learned prefixes (`2.2.2.2/32`, `3.3.3.3/32`, `4.4.4.4/32`) are `next-hop` type with MAC `78:61:32:bf:bc:00` (Spine4's Ethernet0 MAC).
- Local IPs (`1.1.1.1/32`, `1.4.1.1/32`) are `for-us` — packets to these addresses are punted to the CPU.
- The connected subnet (`1.4.1.0/24`) is `host` type — triggers ARP resolution for unknown destinations in that range.
- Default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) shows `drop: True` — unmatched traffic is dropped in hardware.

##### NPU Prefix-to-Nexthop Mapping

Drills into a single prefix and shows the full ASIC forwarding chain: VRF → prefix → nexthop OID → destination MAC → egress L3 port → physical interface.

```bash
sudo show platform npu router prefix -ip 2.2.2.2/32
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
+-------------+------------+---------+------------------+-----------------+
|   vrf oid   |   Prefix   | Is Host | Destination Type | Destination OID |
+-------------+------------+---------+------------------+-----------------+
| la_vrf(265) | 2.2.2.2/32 |  False  |     NEXT_HOP     |      10489      |
+-------------+------------+---------+------------------+-----------------+

+-------+-------------------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------+
|  oid  |    Nexthop MAC    | Nexthop Type | router port(type/oid) |   IfName  |
+-------+-------------------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------+
| 10489 | 78:61:32:bf:bc:00 |  NORMAL(0)   |   la_l3_ac_port/618   | Ethernet0 |
+-------+-------------------+--------------+-----------------------+-----------+
```

The prefix `2.2.2.2/32` is in VRF `la_vrf(265)`, points to nexthop OID `10489`, which rewrites the dst-MAC to `78:61:32:bf:bc:00` and egresses via `Ethernet0`.

##### NPU Next-Hop Table

Shows all nexthop entries programmed in the ASIC, their MAC addresses, and reference counts.

```bash
sudo show platform npu next-hop entries
```

**Leaf1** output:
```
+-------+-------------+-------------------+-----------+---------------+
| index | next-hop-id | mac-addr          | ref-count | next-hop-type |
+-------+-------------+-------------------+-----------+---------------+
| 0     | 0xfff       | None              | 0         | DROP          |
| 1     | 0x0         | None              | 3         | DROP          |
| 2     | 0x1         | 78:61:32:bf:bc:00 | 6         | NORMAL        |
+-------+-------------+-------------------+-----------+---------------+
```

- Leaf1 has a single `NORMAL` nexthop (Spine4's MAC) with `ref-count 6` — six prefixes reference this nexthop (the five BGP routes + one connected subnet via the spine).
- Two `DROP` entries are system defaults.

#### Resolution Chain Summary

A packet to `2.2.2.2` on Leaf1 is forwarded as follows:

```
BGP RIB           →  2.2.2.2/32 via 1.4.1.4 (AS path: 4 2)
FRR RIB           →  B>* 2.2.2.2/32 via 1.4.1.4, Ethernet0, rmapsrc 1.1.1.1
Linux kernel      →  2.2.2.2 via 1.4.1.4 dev Ethernet0 proto bgp src 1.1.1.1
ARP table         →  1.4.1.4 → MAC 78:61:32:bf:bc:00
APP_DB ROUTE      →  nexthop 1.4.1.4, ifname Ethernet0
APP_DB NEIGH      →  78:61:32:bf:bc:00
ASIC_DB ROUTE     →  nexthop OID 0x400000000097e
ASIC_DB NEXT_HOP  →  IP 1.4.1.4, rif OID 0x600000000096b
ASIC_DB NEIGHBOR  →  dst-MAC 78:61:32:BF:BC:00
NPU route-table   →  2.2.2.2/32 → next-hop, MAC 78:61:32:bf:bc:00
NPU prefix        →  OID 10489 → NORMAL → Ethernet0
ASIC forwards     →  Rewrite dst-MAC to 78:61:32:bf:bc:00, egress Ethernet0
```

If any layer in this chain is missing, packets will be dropped. Common failures:
- Route in BGP RIB but not in FRR FIB → nexthop not resolvable (no connected route to the nexthop subnet)
- Route in FIB but ARP `INCOMPLETE` → L2 adjacency broken (interface down, wrong VLAN, MTU mismatch)
- Route in kernel but not in APP_DB → `fpmsyncd` issue (check `systemctl status bgp`)
- Route in APP_DB but not in ASIC_DB → `orchagent` failed to translate to SAI objects (check `show services` and syslog for `orchagent` errors)
- Route in ASIC_DB but not in NPU route-table → SAI SDK failed to program hardware (vendor ASIC issue)

## BGP Logging & Debug

FRR's `debug bgp` commands produce real-time diagnostic output. All categories can be scoped to a specific prefix (e.g., `debug bgp updates prefix 2.2.2.2/32`) or direction (`in`/`out`). Always disable debug when done — it is very verbose and will fill disk.

### Debug Categories

| Category | What it logs | When to use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `neighbor-events` | Session state transitions (Idle → Connect → OpenSent → Established), hold-timer expirations, TCP resets | Session flapping or failing to establish |
| `updates` | Every UPDATE message — prefixes, path attributes, next-hops, withdrawals | Missing or unexpected routes |
| `keepalives` | Every KEEPALIVE exchanged with peers | Diagnosing hold-timer expiry / session drops |
| `bestpath` | Path selection decisions — why a route was chosen or rejected | Route not being selected as expected |
| `zebra` | Route installs/withdrawals between BGP and the kernel RIB | Route in BGP RIB but not in `show ip route` |
| `nht` | Next-hop tracking — reachability changes for BGP next-hops | Next-hop marked unreachable despite connected subnet being present |

### Log Destinations

FRR supports multiple log destinations, configured inside `vtysh` under `configure terminal`. You can enable more than one simultaneously.

| Destination | Command | Where output goes | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------|
| File | `log file /var/log/frr/frr.log` | File inside the BGP container | Most common for debug. Read with `docker exec bgp tail ...` |
| Syslog | `log syslog debugging` | Container rsyslog → host `/var/log/syslog` | Integrates with SONiC's centralized logging pipeline |
| Stdout | `log stdout` | Container stdout (captured by Docker) | Visible via `docker logs bgp` |
| Monitor | `terminal monitor` (inside vtysh) | Current vtysh session only | Real-time view; stops when you exit vtysh |

Use `show logging` inside vtysh to see which destinations are currently active.

### Worked Example — Watching a Session Reset

> **Goal:** Enable neighbor-event and inbound-update logging, reset the BGP session to Spine4, and observe the session come back up and re-learn all routes.

**1. Enable file logging and debug (inside `vtysh`):**

```
configure terminal
log file /var/log/frr/frr.log
log timestamp precision 3
exit

debug bgp neighbor-events
debug bgp updates in
```

**2. Verify debug is active:**

```
show debugging
```

```
BGP debugging status:
  BGP neighbor-events debugging is on
  BGP updates debugging is on (inbound)
```

**3. Trigger a BGP reset and wait a few seconds:**

```bash
vtysh -c 'clear bgp ipv4 unicast 1.4.1.4'
```

**4. Read the log** (the log file lives inside the BGP container):

```bash
docker exec bgp tail -30 /var/log/frr/frr.log
```

**Leaf1** output (trimmed to key lines):
```
2026/04/20 03:11:14.136 BGP: 1.4.1.4 [FSM] Receive_OPEN_message (OpenSent->OpenConfirm), fd 23

2026/04/20 03:11:15.797 BGP: 1.4.1.4(pod12-spine4) rcvd UPDATE w/ attr: nexthop 1.4.1.4, origin ?, metric 0, path 4
2026/04/20 03:11:15.797 BGP: 1.4.1.4(pod12-spine4) rcvd 4.4.4.4/32 IPv4 unicast
2026/04/20 03:11:15.797 BGP: 1.4.1.4(pod12-spine4) rcvd UPDATE about 1.1.1.1/32 IPv4 unicast -- DENIED due to: as-path contains our own AS;
2026/04/20 03:11:15.797 BGP: bgp_update_receive: rcvd End-of-RIB for IPv4 Unicast from 1.4.1.4 in vrf default
```

Reading through the log:
- **03:11:14** — The session transitions OpenSent → OpenConfirm → Established within ~75ms.
- **03:11:15** — Leaf1 sends its own End-of-RIB, then Spine4 sends all its routes.
- Each `rcvd UPDATE` line shows the prefix, next-hop, and AS path — you can see `2.2.2.2/32` arrives with path `4 2` (via Spine4 from Leaf2's AS).
- The update for `1.1.1.1/32` is **DENIED** because the AS path contains Leaf1's own AS (loop prevention).
- The session ends with End-of-RIB from Spine4, confirming the initial table exchange is complete.

**5. Disable debug when done:**

```bash
vtysh -c 'no debug bgp'
```
